        <p>BohConf is <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010" target="_blank">RailsConf 2010</a>'s Unconference. It's not an anti-conf, it's an extension of what RailsConf can be. At BohConf, we're going to get our hands dirty writing code and sharing ideas in an open and free-form environment. Anyone is welcome at BohConf, and there is no registration fee (although free registration is required for security). </p>

        <p>BohConf will be held at the <a href="http://www.bccenter.org" target="_blank">Baltimore Convention Center</a>, June 7 - 9, 2010.</p>

                	<h3>Community Code Drive</h3>
                    <p>The Community Code Drive is a place to meet and work with the authors of many popular open source projects. Come to help hack on code, find and fix bugs, or just watch a seasoned developer at work. Featuring: X from project Y, A from project B, and M from project N.</p>
               	
                	<h3>Code Retreat</h3>
                    <p>Code. Rinse. Repeat. As professional developers we're often coding for profit and rarely coding for practice. In a Code Retreat we'll sharpen our coding skills with a set of exercises done in pairs, and we'll start fresh every time.</p>
               	
                	<h3>Barcamp</h3>
                    <p>A Barcamp is a "user generated conference", so there's structure without an agenda. Bring your own questions and your own answers, and we'll hold our own BohCamp.</p>
               	
                	<h3>Programming Contest</h3>
                    <p>Come flex your coding muscles with a data visualization challenge! We'll unveil a dataset and give participants 24 hours to do whatever they want with it. It doesn't have to be rails (or even a website) but it does have to be cool! Prizes will include (TBD: conference tickets, beer, swag, a certificate of merit, gift certificates, etc)</p>
             
                	<h3>Ruby and Art</h3>
                    <p>Do you like ruby? Do you like art? Do you like taking two things that you like, and then sticking them together to make a bigger thing you like even more? We'll be experimenting with visual art, music, games, and of course, Ruby!</p>
